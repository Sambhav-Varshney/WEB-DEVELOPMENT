    <h1>General Overview
    </h1>
    There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information.
<h3><a href="bysubject.html">by Subject
</a>
</h3><ul>A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use.
</ul>
<h3><a href="bytype.html">by Type</a></h3>
<ul>Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.
</ul>
