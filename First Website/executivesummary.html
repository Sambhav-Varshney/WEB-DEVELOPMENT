    <h1>WorldWideWeb - Summary
    </h1>
    The <a href="WEBSITE.HTML">WWW</a> project merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system.
    <br />
<br />
The project is based on the philosophy that much academic information should be freely available to anyone. It aims to allow information sharing within internationally dispersed teams, and the dissemination of information by support groups. Originally aimed at the High Energy Physics community, it has spread to other areas and attracted much interest in user support, resource discovery and collaborative work areas.

<H2>Reader view</H2>
The WWW world consists of documents, and links. Indexes are special documents which, rather than being read, may be searched. The result of such a search is another ("virtual") document containing links to the documents found. A simple protocol (" <a href="HTTP.HTML">HTTP</a> ") is used to allow a browser program to request a keyword search by a remote information server.
