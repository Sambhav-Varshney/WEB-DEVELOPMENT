    <H1>Why a New Protocol?</H1>
Existing protocols cover a number of different tasks.
<ul>
    <li>Mail protocols allow the transfer of transient messages from a single author to a small number of recipients, at the request of the author.</li>
    <li>File transfer protocols allow the transfer of data at the request of either the sender or receiver, but allow little processing of the data at the responding side.</li>
    <li>News protocols allow the broadcast of transient data to a wide audience.
    </li>
    <li>Search and Retrieve protocols allow index searches to be made, and allow document access. Few exist: Z39.50 is one and could be extended for our needs.
    </li>
    
</ul>
The protocol we need for information access ( <a href="">HTTP</a> ) must provide.
<ul>
    <li>A subset of the file transfer functionality</li>
<li>The ability to request an index search
</li>
<li>Automatic format negotiation.
</li>
<li>The ability to refer the client to another server
</li></ul>
